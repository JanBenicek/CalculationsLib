# Free CalculationsLib
Lib of All for All.

The aim of this library is to offer a library containing all kinds of mathematical calculations with easy to use.

Anyone can get involved in adding computational patterns to this library to extend its capabilities and use.

This Library can be freely used by anyone. I will be happy to share a link to this library when using it, but it is not a requirement for being able to use it.
